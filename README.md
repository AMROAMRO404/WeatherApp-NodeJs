## Create a node.js application that has the following views routes:

- Home => Short welcome text with a beautiful image (image is a must)
- Weather => A brief description of today's weather (you might use any available free weatherapi)
- About

Notes:

- Use an http requests package (postman-request) to get weather data.
- Use 'hbs' as template engine.
- Extra plus for using a nav-bar.
